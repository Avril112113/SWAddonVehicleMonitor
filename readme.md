# VehMon
A addon library to draw stuff to a vehicle's monitor.  
This is still work in progress, so is this readme.  

Currently it works, but many features are missing and multiplayer isn't properly handled YET.  


## Building
`./addon/` is built using [SSSWTool](https://github.com/Avril112113/SSSWTool)  
`./vehicle/` is built using [LifeBoatAPI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NameousChangey.lifeboatapi)
